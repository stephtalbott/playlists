# Getting Started 
Access the app 
[here](https://playlistkeeper.fly.dev/)! 

From the landing page to log in, you will be prompted to sign in using credentials from a Google account. Once logged in, you may create your own playlists and view playlists other users have made! 

# Next Steps 
V2 and beyond planned features:
- a 'copy playlist' button that will allow a user to duplicate another user's playlist so they can add/edit songs as they would like
- implementation of a 3rd party API to render top 40 album artwork on the landing page 
- ability for a user to leave comments on another user's playlists
